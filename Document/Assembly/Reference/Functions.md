A function can be declared by choosing a [name](./Naming.md) and adding a [code block](./CodeBlock.md) to execute. When it comes to naming your function, be sure to use the `Callable` naming style. To declare a function, the name of the function must be placed, then a code block must be placed. Bellow is a recommended example for a function. The code block will be used to store the code of the function.

**Basic Example**
```firestone:ast
MyFunction {

}
```

**Don't**
```firestone:ast
myfunction {

}
```

```firestone:ast
MyFunction 
{

}
```
